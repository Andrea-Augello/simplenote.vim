# simplenote.vim
A vim plugin to interact with the [simplenote][1] API.
Now you can take simple notes directly from your favourite editor.

## Installation and Usage
As I am working on this at the moment, it probably won't work until at least version
`0.1.0`. So watch out for the tag.

## Thanks
[mattn][2], [Tim Pope][3] and [Scrooloose][4] who write awesome vim plugins
which I took as a basis to learn how to write vim plugins.
